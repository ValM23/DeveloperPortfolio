# DeveloperPortfolio
A short Set of projects I've been working on. 

# Resume
Since I am making a change from <strong>Glorified Help Desk</strong> to <em><u>software development</u></em>, I am working on getting my personal projects 
into my public Github. (The Repo you're currently purusing now.)

#Are your projects any good? 
I mean, for a basic developer? I have no idea how good or bad they are. They're just things I've been making in my spare time as again.... <strong><em>A glorified Help Desk Technician.</em></strong>

### Enjoy or cringe. That's your choice.
